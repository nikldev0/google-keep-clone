# Google Keep Clone
Google Keep app clone built using vanilla JavaScript to mimic key functionalities of the app with editable notes in a modal.

## Key Features: 

This project is contained within an App class to organise its behavior. Event listener functions therefore become methods. 
Notes can be added and edited through a pop-up modal.
